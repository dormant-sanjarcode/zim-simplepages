# zim-simplepages

### What
A plugin to add extra "simple" pages to existing ones.

### Why
"Simple" pages are for people who may not understand all the "jargon" used in your notes.
Trust me, this is mostly your future _self_.

### Inspired by
[Simple Wikipedia](https://simple.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Simple_English_Wikipedia&oldid=7466276) feature - For a well known Wikipedia article, replace the URL's starting `en` with `simple` and press `Enter`.
Example: [`en`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Student) vs [`simple`](https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Student) for the 'Student' article.
